# Cardiovascular Disease Analysis with Spark

## Description
This project aims to utilize Apache Spark for preprocessing and conducting statistical analysis on a dataset related to cardiovascular disease. 
The primary objective is to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform correlation analysis to identify significant relationships 
between various health indicators and the presence of cardiovascular disease.

## Dataset
- [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
- The dataset contains various health metrics of patients, including features like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and more.
- with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Pandas
- NumPy




## Deep Neural Network (DNN) Model
In addition to statistical analysis with Spark, this project includes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease. The DNN leverages various health indicators to make predictions, complementing the insights from the Spark-based data analysis.

## Model Details
- Model Type: Deep Neural Network (DNN)
- Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras
- Purpose: To predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on health metrics.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fevtefera/Spark-Data-Analysis-Cardio.git
